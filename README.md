# Tumor Detection Using Logistic Regression

## 📌 Overview
Beginner-level machine learning project for binary classification — predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign.  
This project was completed during my self-learning phase, with partial guidance and partial independent work using Python and Scikit-learn.

## 🧠 Objective
Predict tumor malignancy (Benign or Malignant) based on diagnostic features.  
Binary target: `0 = Benign`, `1 = Malignant`.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 📊 Algorithm Used
- **Logistic Regression**  
Trained a binary classifier to distinguish between benign and malignant tumor records using labeled dataset.

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report  
- Data Visualizations using Seaborn

## 📂 Dataset
- Loaded directly from **`sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()`**  
No external CSV file required — dataset is publicly available and built into Scikit-learn.

## 📝 Notes
This project was built during my early ML learning phase.  
I implemented parts of the code and logic independently, with additional help from ChatGPT to complete and understand it fully.

## 🚀 Status
✅ Completed as a guided practice project  
🔜 Will explore further using other classification algorithms (SVM, Decision Tree, etc.)
